# SPACEWAR

This project is a variation of classic retro game Spacewar shaped around my vision and taste. Use your spaceship for destroying the enemy ships and raise your score! Also my first Raylib project using C# as the coding language.

-----------------------

## ðŸš€FeaturesðŸŒŒ

Smooth and satisfying movement/shooting mechanics.

Different enemy ships with different movesets, look out for unexpected charges!

Carefully balanced level and upgrade system, you will be flying across the map at the end if you are skillful enough!

Scoring system for leveling up and gauge your success on each run.

A boss fight at the end that will test your skills to their limits, be ready.

If you can beat the boss without losing all of your health, you won! If you couldn't, game over.  

Scoreboard for getting competitive with yourself and your friends.

## ðŸ”§Technologies UsedðŸ”¨

Used Visual Studio as IDE for its easy to understand UI. 

Raylib had chosen for handling 2D graphics and recieving input.
